Task Management System

A simple task management system built with Angular (Frontend) and Node.js + Express + MSSQL (Backend). Users can register, login, and manage tasks. Optional enhancements include role-based access and file uploads for tasks.

Frontend

This project was generated using Angular CLI
 version 20.3.3.

Prerequisites

Node.js (v20+ recommended)

Angular CLI installed globally:

npm install -g @angular/cli


Development Server

ng serve


Open your browser at http://localhost:4200/.
The app will automatically reload when you modify any source files.

Code Scaffolding

Angular CLI provides tools to generate components, services, directives, etc.:

ng generate component component-name
ng generate service service-name


For a complete list of schematics:

ng generate --help

Building

To build the project for production:

ng build


Build artifacts are stored in the dist/ directory. Production build optimizes performance.

Running Unit Tests

:

ng test

Running End-to-End Tests

To run e2e tests:

ng e2e


Angular CLI does not include an e2e testing framework by defaultâ€”you can choose your preferred tool (e.g., Cypress, Protractor).
